# Problems and Possibilities

While I was working on this project I encountered only two problems. The first problem I encountered was trying to webscrape basketball-reference.com in order to get NBA players statistics and personal information such as birthdates, birthplaces, and colleges. I spent hours trying to webscrape this website, only to find that someone else had gathered the data basketball-reference.com and uploaded it onto a Microsoft Excel file. However, I soon realized that I did not need to use statistics to argue my points, and therefore did not use data from basketball-reference.com. The second problem I encountered was a minor one, and that was trying to create visualizations. I did not know that it was impossible to upload interactive charts onto github.com until I tried uploading them, and therefore had to change several of my visualizations for my project. Other than those two problems I did not encounter any other issues while working on this project.

Although I did have to change several of my visualizations, I believe that that is where this project is the strongest because I am able to show my viewers how the NBA has changed over time through my visualizations. I used Tableau to create those visualizations, and I believe that it was the best choice for creating my visualizations because I was able to create different charts and tables, as well as use distinct colors in order to emphasize my points of argument.

Lastly, I believe that I can continue to argue about the diversity of races with this project because even though the majority of the NBA is white and black athletes, there is also a number of Asian and Hispanic players as well. In the future, I wish to expand on this project by using basketball-reference.com's database of players to show the diversity by naming the race of each of the 4000+ players to ever play in the NBA. As basketball-reference.com does not state the race of each player, I would have to manually enter each player's race, which was something I could not do for this project due to lack of time. If I am able to do this, I believe that I would be able to solidify and strengthen my argument of Bill Russell opening up a path for non-whites to enter the NBA, therefore helping the league to become a global market.
