Basketball is currently one of the most popular sports played and watched worldwide. Basketball was originally invented in the United States in 1891 by James Naismith, and this newfound sport initially consisted of pick-up games, or spontaneous games where group of players would score the basketball in a basketball hoop. Basketball quickly grew popular and a league where teams competed against each other was formed in 1898. The popularity of basketball constantly grew and led to the formation of a new professional league, the National Basketball Association (NBA), in 1946. Another league, the American Basketball Association (ABA), was formed in 1967, however the ABA and NBA later merged together in 1976 under the name of the NBA. Today, the NBA and basketball in general continues to grow thanks to the fans and the players.

In this project, I aim to tell my readers about pivotal moments that changed the NBA. With the help of Bill Russell, he was able to lead way for racial diversity in the NBA, which caused players like Michael Jordan to rise in popularity and help the NBA to become a global market.

Originally basketball began as a white-dominated league with few, if any, minorities. However, this all changed as soon as Bill Russell entered in the NBA. By revolutionizing the league with his size and defense, he became the first black NBA superstar. By also dealing with the criticisms, racist comments, and proving everyone making those comments wrong, Russell opened up a path for black athletes in the NBA. The path opened up by Russell led the NBA to become a black-dominated league, paving the way for future NBA legends such as Wilt Chamberlain, Oscar Robertson, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Magic Johnson, and Michael Jordan to become successful in the NBA. Lastly, this Boston Celtics legend has one of the most significant accolade held by a single NBA player, as he played from 1956 to 1969, served as a player and coach from 1966 to 1969, he led his team is eleven championship titles, currently still the most championships won by a single player.

Bill Russell wasn't the only person to pave the way for a non-white race to come into the NBA, as Yao Ming helped bring more Asians into the NBA. Yao destroyed all of the stereotypes of Asians being too small to play in the NBA, as this 7'6" giant came into the league as one of the tallest players to ever play in the league. Though his career was cut short due to injuries, this Hall of Fame basketball star was able to inspire fellow Asians and Asian-Americans, such as Yi Jianlian and Jeremy Lin, to attempt a career in the NBA.

Michael Jordan, known to many basketball fans as the greatest basketball player ever, was a dominant figure in the NBA in the 1980s and the 1990s. Jordan, along with Hall of Famer Scottie Pippen, led the Chicago Bulls to a total of six NBA Finals appearances, and a total of six championships, therefore being undefeated in a NBA Finals matchup. Michael Jordan not only revolutionized the NBA as one of the most competitive and fiercest players, he revolutionized the world through Air Jordan, a sub-company of Nike that produces shoes, clothing, and accessories. Air Jordan became the most succesful brand from a basketball player, and inspired other NBA players, such as Kobe Bryant and LeBron James, to create their own shoes and clothing lines. With the popularity of Michael Jordan and Air Jordan worldwide, both assisted in the economical empire known as the NBA.
