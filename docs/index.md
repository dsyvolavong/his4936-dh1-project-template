Basketball is currently one of the most popular sports played and watched worldwide. Basketball was originally invented in the United States in 1891 by James Naismith, and this newfound sport initially consisted of pick-up games, or spontaneous games where group of players would score the basketball in a basketball hoop. Basketball quickly grew popular and a league where teams competed against each other was formed in 1898. The popularity of basketball constantly grew and led to the formation of a new professional league, the National Basketball Association (NBA), in 1946. Another league, the American Basketball Association (ABA), was formed in 1967, however the ABA and NBA later merged together in 1976 under the name of the NBA. Today, the NBA and basketball in general continues to grow thanks to the fans and the players.
