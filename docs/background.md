# Project Background

---

Throughout the history of the NBA, basketball has always faced racism issues. As baskbetball was initially an all-white-male sport, Bill Russell helped integrate black athletes in the NBA, creating an opportunity for minorities to play basketball. With the development of racial integration in the NBA, this opened up a path for basketball players to assist in the global marketing of basketball and the NBA.

## Historical Background

Put a discussion of any relevant historigraphy you think relates to the topic.You can discuss the historiography of specific times and places, but you can also discuss any theoretical literature you think is relevant.

You have freedom to roam from the narrow topic of your project to explore how different authors/schools of thought have impacted scholarly approaches over time. However, make sure that in the end you clearly relate how this discussion relates to the subject of your project and/or your choices in methods or interpreative models.

As you discuss different authors, you may site them using (author, page) style parenthetical notation. Make sure that a full citation in [Chicago](http://chicagomanualofstyle.org) is added to the 'docs/credits.md' page.

Throughout the history of the NBA, several authors have writtten about significant events that changed the NBA. By changing the way the NBA changed its views on the blacks and other minorities, this opened up a path for black athletes to pave way for the NBA to become a global market. With the rise of Michael Jordan, basketball and the NBA became popular worldwide. Soon following Michael Jordan, Kobe Bryant and LeBron James continued to assist in the growth of the NBA worldwide, generating enormous amounts of money for the organization.

## Digital Background

You should also make sure to do research on any relevant digital work, whether scholarly articles or digital projects. Make sure to check Digital Humanities Quarterly, or [DHQ](http://www.digitalhumanities.org/dhq/), [Debates in the Digital Humanities](http://dhdebates.gc.cuny.edu/), [JStor](https://jstor.org), blogs and more to find relevant work.

You don't actually have to have a sepearte 'Digital Background' section. If it feels more natural to you, you may combine them into a single discussion. This is especially a good idea if you feel that with your topic you cannot talk about historiography without also talking about digital scholarship, and vice versa.
