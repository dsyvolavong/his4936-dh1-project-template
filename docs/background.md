Throughout the history of the NBA, basketball has always faced racism issues. As baskbetball was initially an all-white-male sport, Bill Russell helped integrate black athletes in the NBA, creating an opportunity for minorities to play basketball. With the development of racial integration in the NBA, this opened up a path for basketball players to assist in the global marketing of basketball and the NBA.

## Historical Background

Throughout the history of the NBA, several authors have writtten about significant events that changed the NBA. In this section I have combined the different historiographies written in books and in online articles on the different figures that helped revolutionize the NBA racially and economically to transform the league into what it is today.

The NBA initially began as an all-white league, and even though the league allowed blacks to join, racism against blacks still lingered throughout the league. However, that was until Bill Russell entered the league. Russell was the first black superstar in the NBA, and he paved way for more black athletes to emerge in the NBA by facing the racism issues he faced and integrating blacks into the NBA. Several authors have written about the life of Bill Russell and his impact on both the league and the world. Russell's debut sparked great interest from the fans, as he was anticipated by many to be an outstanding basketball player, and he proved them right by having one of the most phenomenal careers of a NBA player (Nelson, 39). Not only did Russell have an impact on the United States as an activist in several civil rights movements, he also had an enormous impact on the rest of the world, as he traveled to Africa to spread the knowledge of basketball on behalf of the United States (Nelson, 53-55). Bill Russell soon made another remarkable impact on the NBA by becoming the first player-coach in the NBA, and some believe that this was an act of a civil rights movement (Nelson, 79). Bill Russell's impact on the court and off the court forever changed the lives of people inside and outside of the NBA, and helped influence the league and the world to be what it is today.

Several digital articles have written about the racism issues against blacks that the early NBA initially faced. Several authors have compared the early NBA to the early United States, as the black athletes had to compete in front of predominantly white audiences and are on teams owned by white people, whereas black slaves had to work and perform for the white masters (Griffin, 162). This ideology is still in place today because the majority and the NBA teams' owners and coaches are white, and most of the players are black, showing that not much has changed in the NBA since Bill Russell's influence. Regarding Russell's influence on the NBA and world, historiographers have written several articles about his revolutionization of basketball. Several authors have written about how Russell not only changed the game of basketball with his size and defense, but also changed it by integrating more black athletes into the NBA by essentially becoming a role model and a civil rights movement leader for the NBA (Goudsouzian, 61).

By changing the way the NBA viewed blacks and other minorities, many historiographers believe that this opened up a path for black athletes to pave way for the NBA to become a global market. One key figure that helped transform the NBA into a global market was Michael Jordan. As soon as the Michael Jordan entered the league in 1984, the athlete signed with Nike and created his own sub-company called 'Air Jordan.' Due to the immense popularity of Jordan and Nike worldwide, this caused the NBA to branch out to other countries in order to sell merchandise, as well as spread basketball and to help them start their own leagues. Although some authors have stated that the idea of an athlete being the face of a company, such as Nike, is unoriginal, they believe that Jordan becoming the face of Nike and Air Jordan was revolutionary (Batchelor, 53) because he helped the company's gross revenue total to about $986 million in 1984, and this number went up to nearly $10 billion in 2002 (Batchelor, 56). Nike was able to gain an immense amount of revenue due to Jordan's signature shoes being sold for thousands of dollars (Batchelor, 56), creating a path for Nike, Air Jodan, and the NBA to all become global markets. However, as Michael Jordan, Air Jordan, and the NBA gained enormous popularity worldwide, several authors have discussed the controversies that came with this popularity. The controversies involving Jordan and the NBA include the exploitation of underpaid Asian workers to manufacture merchandise, as well as targeting poor black children with basketball merchandise (LaFeber, 90), thus proving that in order for the rich to gain money, they have to take money from the poor. However, these controversies did not stop people from buying basketball related merchandise simply because they do not care where it comes from or how much it costs, as long it makes them look unique and special, thus allowing the NBA to become one of the biggest global markets. With the rise of Michael Jordan, basketball and the NBA became popular worldwide. Soon following Michael Jordan, Kobe Bryant and LeBron James continued to assist in the growth of the NBA worldwide, generating enormous amounts of money for the organization.

Several authors have also written online articles about Michael Jordan's legacy. Jordan was often viewed as an role model for children, and was even viewed as an idol for the future generation of NBA players. However, several authors have noticed that even though Michael Jordan was viewed as a role model, he failed to use his status an a NBA superstar to tackle the different social and civil issues in the world (Wright, 2). However, other authors have concluded that it was unfair to expect Jordan to spread awareness about these issues because he is black simply because he did not grow up in a household where race is focused on (Wright, 16). Also, it is unfair to expect other black NBA players such as Kobe Bryant and LeBron James to always speak out regarding issues just because of their skin color and celebrity status. Several authors believe that NBA players have to choose whether or not to speak about social and civil issues, or to remain neutral regarding these issues like Michael Jordan.

Though Yao Ming entered the NBA after Michael Jordan and Kobe Bryant, he managed to quickly changed the way the NBA and it's fans viewed Asian basketball players, as he broke the stereotype of Asians being too short to play basketball. Like Bill Russell, Yao initially faced racism issues, as Yao was a victim of phantom calls. Phantom calls are decisions made by referees based off of racial or ethnical biases. As Yao Ming was called for a number of fouls in the 2004-05 NBA playoffs against the Dallas Mavericks, these phantom calls caused the Houston Rockets to lose the series against the Mavericks, leading many people to believe that Yao Ming was a victim of phantom calls (Farred, 1). Some of the people who noticed these phantom calls concluded either the referees were paid off by the white NBA team owners to make calls against Yao, or that Yao was subjected to phantom calls because he was more vulnerable to phantom calls because of his lighter skin when compared to black NBA players (Farred, 27). Though Yao was not the first victim of phantom calls, the numerous phantom calls against Yao helped changed the NBA. As Yao faced these phantom calls, he helped changed the NBA politically by using the calls as a tool to compare race and globalization, as a way to address racism, and a way to bridge China and the United States (Farred, 32-3), becoming not only a fan favorite, but also a symbol of both China and the NBA. Though his career fell short due to constant injuries, Yao Ming was able to majorly influence and spread basketball in Asia by facing the racism issues head-on and peacefully, thus being a pivotal figure in the globalization of the NBA and basketball.

For the digital sources written about Yao Ming's influence on the world, many authors have stated that Yao not only helped basketball by dealing with racial issues, but by also dealing with political issues. Yao was seen a key figure by many people in expanding the NBA and basketball into China, thus creating political bonds between the United States and China (Keeler and Nauright, 203-204). Authors have also stated that Yao entering the NBA was to ensure trust between China and the United States, as China could have refused to let Yao go to the United States, but that would mean that China would have no trust in the NBA and the United States (Keeler and Nauright, 208-209). As Yao soon grew immensely popular, the number of Asian-American attendances in Houston Rockets games grew in both home and away games (Keeler and Nauright, 216). With the popularity of Yao Ming, the bond and trust between the China, the United States, and the NBA grew, and Yao was the center piece of this newly found relationship.
