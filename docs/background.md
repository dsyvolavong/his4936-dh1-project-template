# Project Background

---

Throughout the history of the NBA, basketball has always faced racism issues. As baskbetball was initially an all-white-male sport, Bill Russell helped integrate black athletes in the NBA, creating an opportunity for minorities to play basketball. With the development of racial integration in the NBA, this opened up a path for basketball players to assist in the global marketing of basketball and the NBA.

## Historical Background

Put a discussion of any relevant historigraphy you think relates to the topic.You can discuss the historiography of specific times and places, but you can also discuss any theoretical literature you think is relevant.

You have freedom to roam from the narrow topic of your project to explore how different authors/schools of thought have impacted scholarly approaches over time. However, make sure that in the end you clearly relate how this discussion relates to the subject of your project and/or your choices in methods or interpreative models.

As you discuss different authors, you may site them using (author, page) style parenthetical notation. Make sure that a full citation in [Chicago](http://chicagomanualofstyle.org) is added to the 'docs/credits.md' page.

Throughout the history of the NBA, several authors have writtten about significant events that changed the NBA. 

By changing the way the NBA changed its views on the blacks and other minorities, this opened up a path for black athletes to pave way for the NBA to become a global market. With the rise of Michael Jordan, basketball and the NBA became popular worldwide. Soon following Michael Jordan, Kobe Bryant and LeBron James continued to assist in the growth of the NBA worldwide, generating enormous amounts of money for the organization. 

Though Yao Ming entered the NBA after Michael Jordan and Kobe Bryant, he managed to quickly changed the way the NBA and it's fans viewed Asian basketball players, as he broke the stereotype of Asians being too short to play basketball. Like Bill Russell, Yao initially faced racism issues, as Yao was a victim of phantom calls. Phantom calls are decisions made by referees based off of racial or ethnical biases. As Yao Ming was called for a number of fouls in the 2004-05 NBA playoffs against the Dallas Mavericks, these phantom calls caused the Houston Rockets to lose the series against the Mavericks, leading many people to believe that Yao Ming was a victim of phantom calls (Farred, 1). Some of the people who noticed these phantom calls concluded either the referees were paid off by the white NBA team owners to make calls against Yao, or that Yao was subjected to phantom calls because he was more vulnerable to phantom calls because of his lighter skin when compared to black NBA players (Farred, 27). Though Yao was not the first victim of phantom calls, the numerous phantom calls against Yao helped changed the NBA. As Yao faced these phantom calls, he helped changed the NBA politically by using the calls as a tool to compare race and globalization, as a way to address racism, and a way to bridge China and the United States (Farred, 32-3), essentially becoming a symbol of both China and the NBA. Though his career fell short due to constant injuries, Yao Ming was able to majorly influence and spread basketball in Asia by facing the racism issues head-on and peacefully, thus being a pivotal figure in the globalization of the NBA and basketball.

## Digital Background

You should also make sure to do research on any relevant digital work, whether scholarly articles or digital projects. Make sure to check Digital Humanities Quarterly, or [DHQ](http://www.digitalhumanities.org/dhq/), [Debates in the Digital Humanities](http://dhdebates.gc.cuny.edu/), [JStor](https://jstor.org), blogs and more to find relevant work.

You don't actually have to have a sepearte 'Digital Background' section. If it feels more natural to you, you may combine them into a single discussion. This is especially a good idea if you feel that with your topic you cannot talk about historiography without also talking about digital scholarship, and vice versa.
