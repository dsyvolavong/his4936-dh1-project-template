# Source Analysis

## Basic Source Information

I used a total of three data sources for my research. The first data source is a dataset on data.world (https://data.world/gmoney/nba-players-birthplaces), and the data was gathered by Gabe Salzer and Selene Arrazolo. The second data source is also a dataset found on data.world (https://data.world/gmoney/nba-team-annual-attendance), and the data in this dataset was also gathered by Gabe Salzer. The last source that I used contained data gathered by Tristan Malherbe, and is a dataset posted on data.world (https://data.world/datatouille/nba-finals-and-mvps).

## Authorship

* Is there any information available discussing the process by which the information was gathered, or how the digital project was constructed?
* How transparent is the project about the choices they made in gathering and transforming the data for digitalization? [Click here for an example of a an excellent 'About' page from a database about Anglo-Saxons](http://www.pase.ac.uk/about/index.html)
* Do the organizations or individuals involved in gathering and publishing your data set have any stated goals or agendas?
* Do the organizations or individuals involved seem to have any unstated agendas or goals?
* If a 3rd party funded the project, who are they? Do they have any particular perspective?

For the first data source created by Gabe Salzer and Selene Arrazolo, it states on the data source page that this information was gathered on basketball-reference.com (https://www.basketball-reference.com/), therefore it is possible that Salzer and Arrazolo either manually entered the data into a Microsoft Excel file, or possibly used a webscraper tool to gather the data. On the webpage for the data source, Salzer and Arrazolo do not discuss the choices they made in transforming the data for digitalization, as they did not include an 'About' page. Also, the two do not have any stated goals, and the only possible unstated goal is spreading data about NBA players. Lastly, it does not seem that there is any third party that funded this project.

In the second data set created by Gabe Salzer, Salzer states that he gathered the data that he used for his dataset from espn.com (http://www.espn.com/nba/attendance/_/year/2001), but Salzer does not discuss the process in which he gathered the data, but it is possible that he either manually entered the data onto a Microsoft Excel file, or used a webscrapping tool to gather the data.

, but Salzer does not discuss the process in which he gathered the data, but it is possible that he either manually entered the data onto a Microsoft Excel file, or used a webscrapping tool to gather the data. On the webpage where I found the dataset, Salzer does not discuss the choices he made in transforming the data for digitalization, nor does he mention any goals he had in creating this dataset. The only possible unstated goal that Salzer may have is spreading the information of NBA. Lastly, it does not seem that there is any third party that funded this project because Salzer does not mention any other organization or person on his webpage.

## Data Analysis

* Do the datasets involved reflect the viewpoints of particular groups or institutions, and if so, who?
* What kinds of categorizations do you find in the data, and do they seem reasonable?
* Do the means of data collection or categorization affect how the data is constructed in any way?
* Does the website contain any tools for visualizing the data? Do they seem like they are making any kind of arguments?
