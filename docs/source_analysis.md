# Source Analysis

## Basic Source Information

I used a total of three data sources for my research. The first data source is a dataset on data.world (https://data.world/gmoney/nba-players-birthplaces), and the data was gathered by Gabe Salzer and Selene Arrazolo. The second data source is also a dataset found on data.world (https://data.world/gmoney/nba-team-annual-attendance), and the data in this dataset was also gathered by Gabe Salzer. The last source that I used contained data gathered by Tristan Malherbe, and is a dataset posted on data.world (https://data.world/datatouille/nba-finals-and-mvps).

## Authorship

For the first data source created by Gabe Salzer and Selene Arrazolo, it states on the data source page that this information was gathered on basketball-reference.com (https://www.basketball-reference.com/), therefore it is possible that Salzer and Arrazolo either manually entered the data into a Microsoft Excel file, or possibly used a webscraper tool to gather the data. On the webpage for the data source, Salzer and Arrazolo do not discuss the choices they made in transforming the data for digitalization, as they did not include an 'About' page. Also, the two do not have any stated goals, and the only possible unstated goal is spreading data about NBA players. Lastly, it does not seem that there is any third party that funded this project.

In the second data set created by Gabe Salzer, Salzer states that he gathered the data that he used for his dataset from espn.com (http://www.espn.com/nba/attendance/_/year/2001), but Salzer does not discuss the process in which he gathered the data, but it is possible that he either manually entered the data onto a Microsoft Excel file, or used a webscrapping tool to gather the data. On the webpage where I found the dataset, Salzer does not discuss the choices he made in transforming the data for digitalization, nor does he mention any goals he had in creating this dataset. The only possible unstated goal that Salzer may have is spreading the information of NBA. Lastly, it does not seem that there is any third party that funded this project because Salzer does not mention any other organization or person on his webpage.

In the last data set, Tristan Malherbe does not state where he gathered his data that he used for his dataset from, nor did Malherbe discuss the process in which he gathered the data for his dataset or the choices he made in transforming data for digitalization. However, Malherbe did state that he created this dataset for fun, as he states that he is a basketball player and is passionate about basketball. Malherbe does not seem to have any unstated goals for his dataset. Lastly, it does not seem that Malherbe was funded by a third party for this project.

## Data Analysis

The datasets created by Gabe Salzer, Selene Arrazolo, and Tristan Malherbe do not reflect any particular viewpoints of any groups or institutions, as it seems that the datasets were created as a general and neutral standpoint on the NBA. Each dataset was categorized geographically (NBA players' birthplaces), numerically (number of attendances each season), and nominally (NBA MVPs and Finals teams). These categorizations seem reasonable because it makes the datasets easier for viewers to read and understand the subject of each dataset. For each of the datasets, it does not seem that the means of collecting the data did not affect how the data was constructed. Each dataset does contain a visual on each webpage, but it does not seem that the creators are making an argument, as it seems that the visuals were made to help viewers understand the data more easily.
