In this section, I have made visualization for the different datasets that I used for my research. Through the data that I used and the visualizations that I created, I have found that even though blacks were not initially welcomed into the NBA, the NBA transformed into a black-athlete-dominated league with the help of Bill Russell, and the NBA was also able to transform into a global market with the help of athletes like Michael Jordan.

In this visualization of NBA players, I have used a dataset created by Gabe Salzer and Selene Arrazolo to see the correlation of the number of NBA players and their races to which states produce the most NBA players. The NBA is known to have a significantly larger number of blacks athletes, however through this dataset I realized that the states that produce the most blacks often produce the most NBA players. According to blackdemographics.com (http://blackdemographics.com/population/black-state-population/), the states that have the greatest number of blacks were southern and eastern states, and California. This visualization also shows that southern and eastern states and California has produced the greatest number of NBA players.

In this visualization, I used a dataset created by Gabe Salzer to show the result of the global marketing of the NBA post-Michael Jordan era by showing the total number of attendances each team had and the amount of money each NBA team generated in a span of fifteen years. From the year 2000 to 2015, the number of fans and money the NBA has generated consistantly increased, allowing the NBA to become one of the most wealthy sports league. This visualization shows that there have been a total of 334,094,544 home games attendances between 2000 and 2015 during the regular NBA season, not including the playoffs. The average ticket for a NBA game is about $80, this means that between 2000 and 2015 the NBA generated a total of $26,727,563,520 from home game attendances, not including the sales of merchandise and playoff tickets the NBA also generated. The amount of money the NBA generated is a direct result of the global market that the NBA became during the times of NBA legends such as Bill Russell, Wilt Chamberlain, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Larry Bird, Magic Johnson, Hakeem Olajuwon and Michael Jordan.

For these two visuals, I gathered data from a dataset created by Tristan Malherbe to analyze the correlation between NBA MVPs and Finals MVPs and their races. Though there were few non-white athletes in the early stages of the NBA and many prejudices against black athletes, this visualization shows that black athletes were more likely to be given the MVP and Finals MVP awards. This result may be shocking to some viewers because the two prestigious awards were voted by a committee on who to decide which awards were to be given to who, especially during the time of Bill Russell and Wilt Chamberlain. However, one of the most shocking things about this visual is that within the span of 62 years, there have only been seven non-black MVPs (two being non-American citizens) and seven non-black Finals MVPs.
